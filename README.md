# SingleCraft | Pre-Alpha

SingleCraft is a powerful minecrafts server hosting in Python.

# How to use ?

Singlecraft need a MySQL database for save server configuration (Like, launch jar, server name, and much more)

So, for now, we need to add yourself the line `DatabaseManager.SetupDatabase()` at the `@app.route('/')` line
When you have launched the website, go to the root page (E.g: localhost:5000/).

So remove the line `DatabaseManager.SetupDatabase()` when your database is correctly setup !

## F.A.Q

- Any simplified installation process in the futur?
  Yes.

*I will add more frequently asked questions later!*
